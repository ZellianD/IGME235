            <p>The endocrine system consists of the body's glands and the hormones they secrete. 
                It regulates the biological process of the body from conception through old age. 
                It monitors the development of all other systems of the body.</p>

                <h1 class="pit">The Pituitary Gland</h1>
                <p> The pituitary gland receives signals from the hypothalamus
                     (which connects the nervous and endocrine systems together and is what drives the endocrine system) 
                     It’s hormones control other glands such as he thyroid gland, adrenal glands, and the reproductive glands.
                     It is responsible for the controls of how the body grows. In addition 
                     the posterior lobe produces vasopressin and oxytocin. 
                </p>
                <h1 class="pin">The Pineal Gland</h1>
                <p>The pineal gland is a small gland in the brain that manages the sleep cycle and releases melatonin.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="thyroid">
                <h1 class="thy">The Thyroid Gland</h1>
                <p>The thyroid is what regulates the body’s metabolism. Similar to the pituitary gland the thyroid also regulates
                    growth and development of the body.
                </p>
                <h1 class="parathy">The Parathyroid Gland</h1>
                <p>There are four parathyroid glands that rest with the thyroid. The glands control the level of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium in the body.
                    Calcium is crutial for the heart, kidneys, bones, and the nervous system.
                </p>
                <h1 class="thym">The Thymus Gland</h1>
                <p>The thymus is a small gland that is part of the lymphatic system. 
                    It is responsible for making and training T-lymphocytes (T-cells). T-cells are a special type of 
                    white blood cell that fight disease and infection. Most T-cells are produced before birth.
                    The body will produce all the T-cells needed in your life by the time puberty is hit.

            <div id="kidney">
                <h1 class="adr">The Adrenal Gland</h1>
                <p> The adrenal gland sits right on top of the kidneys. It controls metaplasm, 
                    the immune system, blood pressure, and sexual development. 
                    The gland responses highly to stress.

            </div>
            <div id="pancreas">
                <h1 class="pan">The Pancreas</h1>
                <p>The pancreas plays a significant role in the endocrine and digestive system. It secretes insulin, 
                    which controls the level of blood sugar in the blood.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h1 class="tes">The Testes</h1>
                <p>The testes are apart of the male reproductive system. They produce and store sperm.
                    They are responsible for the release the hormone testosterone which effects sperm production, muscle strength, and sex drive. 
                </p>
                <h1 class="ova">The Ovaries</h1>
                <p>The ovaries are apart of the female reproductive system. They release eggs into the uterus and store eggs. 
                    People are born with all the eggs they will ever have. 
                    The ovaries release the sex hormones estrogen, progesterone, oestrogen, and testosterone. 
                    Testosterone is supposed to be the highest during ovulation.
