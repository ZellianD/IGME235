                <!-- Copy pasted from Moby Games  -->
                <p>
                    Diablo III is the third instalment in Blizzard's franchise. The plot is set twenty years after the events of Diablo II,
                     when a star falls on the cathedral in Old Tristram (the same cathedral that the hero had to explore down to the depths of Hell in the original Diablo).
                      The hero, one of five classes (Barbarian, Monk, Demon Hunter, Witch-doctor and Wizard), male or female, sets off to investigate the mysterious falling star.
                    <br><br>
                    The game, like its predecessors, is a dungeon crawler in which the player fights against hordes of enemies ranging from beasts and undead to actual demons. 
                    The environment is made of various maps. The towns and cities have predefined maps, and the fields and dungeons have randoms maps.
                     These maps are reset any time the player reloads the game. The game has four acts, two game modes (normal and hardcore) as well as four difficulty levels:
                      Normal, Nightmare, hell and Inferno. In hardcore mode, defeat is not allowed. The patches also added «monster power» setting, 
                      which allows to scale selected difficulty additionally from 1 to 10.
                    <br><br>
                    Reaper of Souls is the first expansion for Diablo III. The plot from Reaper of Souls starts the fifth act of the main game. After Diablo's defeat, 
                    Tyrael and the Horadrim set to hide the Black Soulstone containing his essence in heaven, but the Angel of Death, Malthael, 
                    took it from them to use it for his own agenda. Upon Tyrael's request, the Hero will travel to Westmarch to confront Malthael and his reaper army.

                        While legacy certainly has something to do with it, Diablo III goes beyond a mere nostalgia trip;
                         it's a fundamentally improved experience that may once again change the ways developers look at creating RPGs.
                          It takes the core experience that made Diablo II great and makes it less frustrating and, more importantly, much more accessible.
                           Where Diablo II encouraged careful planning and forethought, Diablo III encourages experimentation and fun.
