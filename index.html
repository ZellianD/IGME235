            <strong>What's up everybody!</strong> Welcome back to my 235 homepage. If you're new around here my name is Zellian.
            I'm a Game Design and Development major minoring in Molecular Biology. 
            My goal is to make medical simulations to train medical professionals along with other tools for the medical industry.
            This is my second year learning here at RIT, although I grew up on campus when my dad used to work here. 
            Now bricks consume all my waking thoughts. 
            Out of this class, I hope to be able to start making basic web access simulation experiences and to continue to hone my programming skills.
            Some more things about me, I have a decent amount of weird interests. 
            To qoute my mom <q>You cut things up, bleach things, grow things, bake things, stuff things</q>. 
            I have done taxidermy, I collect bugs, plants, and bones along with other oddities. 
            I love the Diablo franchise and FNAF. 
            And all my other interests have disapeared from my head the moment anybody asks. 
            But have trust that I am a cool hardworking person.
